# BPR_toolbox
It provides BPR (Blink-locked Pupillary Response) correction toolbox and other preprocessing codes for pupillometry.

It is not well known that eyeblink disturbs pupillomtery by transient constriction and re-dilation after blinking offset. 
The toolbox corrects 

It is easy to apply your pupil data. It requires just pupil time course as an input. 

The BPR correction toolbox can be applied any pupil data if it has preprocessed pupil time course. The rest preprocessing codes was written for pupil data from Eyelink. 

Please read Yoo et al. 2021 (in revision, I will notate it as soon as it is published) to indetify what's going on in pupillometry when a subject blinks, model and algorithm for correction, and how it is validated.

We always welcome researchers who want to comment, modify, or improve the toolbox.
